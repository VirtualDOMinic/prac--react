# Official intro to react: tic tac toe
Following "[Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)"

Tutorial doesn't assume any existing React knowledge, and involves building a small game: a way to learn fundamental React techniques by "doing"

## Notes
Misc notes taken as I follow the tutorial:
1. Decided to set up local dev environment using `create react app` (`npm i -g create-react-app`)
    1. `create react app tictactoe`
    2. Woo! After `cd`ing inside and `npm start`ing I successfully got the "Welcome to React" page :)
    3. Now time to get rid of what I've been given: `rm -f src/*`
    4. Added `index.css` and `index.js` with their respective boilerplate (or slightly beyond IMO) content
    5. `npm start` successfully loads up the 3x3 table/grid
2. Note: installed `sublime babel` VS Code extension, as per the tutorial's recommendation
3.
